## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and Grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This is the first challenge in which I use JavaScript code for interactions. I also tried a simple flip animation for transitioning between card sides.

### Continued development

Since I'm just starting my learning of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web development in general, I'm still focusing on learning every aspect of these technologies, mainly the fundamentals.
